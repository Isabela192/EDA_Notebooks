# Exploratory Data Analysis

This repo saves some work that I've done with differents types of data.
This is a ongoing project as I find more and more exciting thigs to explore.

For this repo specificaly I'm using conda as my dependencies manager, since it's easier
to install geographic lybraries with it.
